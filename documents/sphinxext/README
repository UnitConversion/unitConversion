How I modified mathmpl.py:

try /usr/bin/latex2html
-> it makes pages and too complicated

found latex2png.py
in that file used dvipng directly.
-> space problem (empty spaces around the equations)

found /usr/bin/latex2png -> .png is not clear
-> found convert (ImageMagick)

use dvipng directly and convert to remove the empty spaces!
