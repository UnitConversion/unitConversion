The MUNICONV Service
====================

Introduction
------------
MUNICONV (Multiple UNIt CONVversion) is a unit conversion service. The first iteration targets the NSLS II magnet unit conversion between engineering units (e.g. Ampere), physics units (e.g. Tesla), and model units (e.g. K1, K2). It uses the IRMIS 3 schema as its RDB backend, and MySQL as the RDBMS.
