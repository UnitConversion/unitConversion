This project is developed for NSLS II magnet unit conversion, between engineering unit (Ampere for example), 
physics unit (Tesla for example), and model unit (K1, K2 for example).

It uses IRMIS 3 schema, which is developed by D. Dohan at NSLS II, with minor modification. For the future 
maintenance purpose, it uses the same architecture with the pyirmis project.

Required package:
(inherited from pyirmis project. To be optimized later.)
