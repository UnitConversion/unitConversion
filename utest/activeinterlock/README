this unit test needs a configuration file, rdbinfo.py, under rdbutils directory to point to a MySQL database server.
The content of that file is as below:

host = '' # host name/ip address or full socket path
user = '' # user name if it has
pw = ''   # password if it has
db = ''   # database name
dbp = ''  # database port
